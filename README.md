Title: Classification of The Ripeness of Cantaloupe Fruits Based on Fruit Skin Color Texture Using Naive Bayes Classifier Method

Abstrak: 
Manual sorting of cantaloupe fruit by human results takes a long time and subjective. Therefore we need the method for classification of the ripeness of cantaloupe based on fruit skin color texture that will give the results more objective and fast. The main objective of this research is to classify the ripeness of cantaloupe fruit using the Naive Bayes Classifier method and compare its accuracy results with the Learning Vector Quantization Artificial Neural Network method. The main characteristic of the Naive Bayes Classifier is a very strong assumption (naive) of the independence of each variable based on Bayes Theorem. This research used 15 of each image of raw cantaloupe and mature cantaloupe. A total of 16 images are grouped into training data for the training process and the other 14 images are grouped into test data for the testing process. This research used Matlab R2016a software. The results of this research show that the accuracy of training and testing by the Naive Bayes Classifier method is lower compared to the LVQ Artificial Neural Network method.
